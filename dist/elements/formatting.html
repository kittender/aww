    detail.</p>
    
    <h4>Marked</h4>
    <p>There was nothing <mark>so very remarkable</mark> in that; nor did Alice think it <mark>so very much</mark> out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over <mark>afterwards</mark>, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but <mark>when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</mark>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or <mark>a watch</mark> to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down <mark>a large rabbit-hole</mark> under the hedge. </p>
